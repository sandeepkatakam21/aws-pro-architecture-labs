## Section Directories

### `/ec2-automation`
Automated EC2 lifecycle management with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Includes auto-scaling, patch management, and cost optimization strategies using Terraform, CloudFormation, and Systems Manager.

### `/s3-data-lake`
Enterprise data lake architecture on S3 with data ingestion pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics integration. Features data partitioning, lifecycle policies, and integration with AWS Glue, Athena, and Redshift.

### `/lambda-serverless`
Serverless application patterns and microservices architecture using AWS Lambda. Covers event-driven processing, API Gateway integrations, and serverless orchestration with Step Functions.

### `/blue-green-eks`
Blue/Green deployment pipeline for Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). Implements GitOps workflows, automated testing, and zero-downtime deployments with monitoring and rollback capabilities.
