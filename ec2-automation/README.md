# EC2 Automation

## Section Overview

This section focuses on automated EC2 lifecycle management with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It covers comprehensive automation strategies for EC2 instances including provisioning, scaling, patch management, cost optimization, and security hardening. The implementations demonstrate enterprise-grade solutions for managing EC2 fleets at scale with production-ready patterns and best practices.

## Example IaC Tools to Use

- **Terraform** - Infrastructure provisioning and state management
- **CloudFormation** - Native AWS infrastructure as code
- **CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** - Infrastructure using familiar programming languages
- **SAM (Serverless Application Model)** - For serverless compute automation
- **Helm** - Package manager for Kubernetes when managing containerized workloads on EC2

## Project Ideas and Workflow Designs

### Project 1: Auto-Scaling Fleet Management
**Objective**: Implement intelligent auto-scaling for EC2 fleets based on custom metrics and business requirements.

**Key Components**:
- Multi-tier auto-scaling groups with different scaling policies
- Custom CloudWatch metrics for application-specific scaling
- Integration with Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Predictive scaling using AWS Auto Scaling
- Cross-AZ deployment for high availability

**Workflow Design**:
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Terraform to create VPC, subnets, security groups, and launch templates
2. **Auto-Scaling Configuration**: Configure scaling policies based on CPU, memory, and custom application metrics
3. **Load Balancer Integration**: Set up ALB with health checks and target group registration
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for scaling events
5. **Cost Optimization**: Implement spot instance integration and right-sizing recommendations

### Project 2: Automated Patch Management System
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive patch management solution using AWS Systems Manager for EC2 instances.

**Key Components**:
- Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching
- Maintenance windows for controlled patch deployment
- Compliance reporting and drift detection
- Rollback mechanisms for failed patches
- Integration with AWS Config for compliance monitoring

**Workflow Design**:
1. **Patch Baseline Creation**: Define patch baselines for different OS types and environments
2. **Maintenance Window Setup**: Schedule maintenance windows with proper approval workflows
3. **Compliance Monitoring**: Set up AWS Config rules to monitor patch compliance
4. **Automated Remediation**: Configure Systems Manager Automation for compliance remediation
5. **Reporting Dashboard**: Create CloudWatch dashboards for patch status and compliance metrics

### Project 3: Infrastructure Security Hardening
**Objective**: Implement automated security hardening and compliance monitoring for EC2 instances.

**Key Components**:
- Automated security group management
- Instance security baseline enforcement
- Vulnerability scanning integration
- Security compliance monitoring
- Automated response to security events

**Workflow Design**:
1. **Security Baseline Configuration**: Use Systems Manager State Manager for security configurations
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Integrate Amazon Inspector for continuous vulnerability assessment
3. **Compliance Monitoring**: Set up AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings
4. **Automated Remediation**: Configure Lambda functions for automated security incident response
5. **Audit and Reporting**: Create compliance reports using AWS Config and Security Hub
